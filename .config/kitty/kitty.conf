# Fonts {{{
# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:
# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Medium
# italic_font Operator Mono Book Italic
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic
#
# You can get a list of full family names available on your computer by running
# kitty list-fonts
# The default values shown below rely on your OS to choose an appropriate monospace font family.

# Adjust the cell dimensions.
# You can use either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
# (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
# unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less than
# 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering artifacts).

# Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the
# specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need special
# rendering for some symbols, such as for Powerline. Avoids the need for
# patched fonts. Each unicode code point is specified in the form U+<code point
# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# Syntax is:
#
# symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name
#
# For example:
#
# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols

# Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode characters
# These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the monitor DPI to arrive at
# a pixel value. There must be four values corresponding to thin, normal, thick,
# and very thick lines;

# Performance tuning {{{
# Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it, increases
# frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage. The default value
# yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for most uses. Note that to
# actually achieve 100FPS you have to either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a
# monitor with a high refresh rate.
repaint_delay    8

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in the terminal
# is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase responsiveness, but also
# increase CPU usage and might cause flicker in full screen programs that
# redraw the entire screen on each loop, because kitty is so fast that partial
# screen updates will be drawn.
input_delay 3

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This prevents
# tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) when scrolling. However,
# it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your monitor. With a
# very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency.
# If so, set this to no.

# Color scheme {{{

# The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is opaque and 0 is fully transparent.
# This will only work if supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under X11). Note
# that it only sets the default background color's opacity. This is so that
# things like the status bar in vim, powerline prompts, etc. still look good.
# But it means that if you use a color theme with a background color in your
# editor, it will not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
# default background color in your kitty config and not use a background color
# in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set the terminals
# default colors in a shell script to launch your editor.
# Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.
